===============
Core War dot JS
===============

Core War is a programming game (see: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Core_War).

This is a javascript implementation of the engine (and hopefully soon some
visuals).

Parsing Redcode is actually pretty complex, so I wrapped the parser from pMARS 
(the Core War standard) to provide a binding for Node.

The eventual goal of this project is to provide a website arena to host battles.

Licensing
=========

Because I have the pMARS code in here I think this ends up being GPL also.
